# User Stories

🐿️ As a user, I am able to sign up for an account and create a user profile

🐿️ As a user, I am able to log in and out of my account

🐿️ As a user, I am able to create posts on my profile timeline

🐿️ As a user, I am able to see all posts by all users on a global timeline

# Stretch Stories

🐿️ As a user, I am able to see a list of other user's posts and/or profiles on the site

🐿️ As a user, I am able able to visit other user profiles

🐿️ As a user, I am able to follow other users

🐿️ As a user, I am able to like posts I think are good, and see how many likes a post has

# Requirements

🎯 Use Clerk.com to set up user signup and login.

🎯 Use the Clerk userId to associate posts with a user.

🎯 Enable each user to create a profile associated with their userId, and a form to input their biography and location data, etc. with a URL similar to /user/[userId].

🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with the userId, and display those posts on the user's profile page

🎯 Show a 404 error if a user profile doesn't exist

🎯 Use at least 1 Radix UI Primitive or similar

## Stretch Goals

🏹 Enable users to visit other user profiles after seeing their posts on a global timeline

🏹 Enable users to follow other users by creating a follower and followee relationship between two user profiles

🏹 Enable users to like other users' posts by creating a user_id and liked_post relationship in a junction table

🏹 A user's biography cannot be blank. If a user logs in but doesn't have a biography set, they should be asked to fill one in

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Reflection

The first thing I did was decide on my database tables. I made two. One named socialmedia_users with columns id, clerk_id (this is linked to the posts table as user), post, username (which is linked to the posts table as username), bio, location, and age. The second table is named socialmedia_posts with columns id, user, post, and username. I also implemented Clerk, a user authentication platform. When the user arrives on the page for the first time they will not be logged in and so they will be presented with buttons to sign in or sign up. If they sign in they are redirected to the home page. If they sign up, they are then redirected to the welcome page, which is not on the nav bar. On this page, they are greeted with a welcome message and are instructed to create a user profile by clicking a button.

When the user is signed in, they can access the full site. On most pages, there is a button that directs them to “My profile”. When the user accesses this page if they have no socialmedia_user row associated with their Clerk id a form to create their profile is rendered. If they already have data on the database instead their user information, their posts, and the form to make a new post are rendered. On their profile page, they can delete their posts.

The user list button on the nav bar takes them to a list of all users on the platform. This is generated by fetching data from the user table and displaying their name. The names are links to their profile pages. On these profile pages the bio, location, age, username, and posts are visible. These profiles are part of the view/[user] path. If the user doesn’t exist I made an if condition so that if the query that runs based on the username comes back empty then a page that says user doesn’t exist page and shows the user a button to return home.

When the users are logged in, they have a user button on the right-hand side of the nav bar. Clicking on this button allows them to manage their account and sign out.
I also created a posts page. On this page, if the user has already created their profile, they can make posts and view all posts on the website. If they have not yet set up their profile, they are only able to view posts, not make them. Each post has a link to the profile of the user that made it.

I used a radix-ui element on my project. When I came to add one of the primitives I had already created and implemented all of my interactive elements. Due to this, I did not want to deconstruct what I had already made to add a pre-made component to the project. I settled on the separator primitive as it was useful to break up the page and wouldn’t have interfered with the elements I already had in place.

I made several test accounts to use Clerk with. You can see/ access these accounts in app/lib/testaccounts.md

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
